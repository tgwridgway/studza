One megapixel = 1 million pixels.\nCalculation: Multiply the horizontal pixels by the vertical pixels.\nExample: A camera with 4000 x 3000 pixels = 12 000 000 pixels = 12 megapixels (MP).\nHigher megapixels = more detail in the image.",
  },
  {
    id: 33,
    unit: "hw",
    q: "What is scanner resolution and what values are typical for print vs. screen?",
    a: "Scanner resolution is measured in dpi (dots per inch) — the number of dots the scanner captures per inch.\n300 dpi is the standard for printing (high quality).\n72 dpi is sufficient for screen/web display.\nHigher dpi = better quality but larger file size.",
  },
  {
    id: 34,
    unit: "hw",
    q: "List and explain six factors that determine monitor display quality.",
    a: "1. Resolution — number of pixels (e.g. 1920 x 1080); more pixels = sharper image\n2. Colour depth — number of bits used per pixel to represent colour (e.g. 24-bit = 16.7 million colours)\n3. Pixel density (PPI) — pixels per inch; higher PPI = sharper, more detailed display\n4. Refresh rate — how many times per second the screen redraws (measured in Hz); higher = smoother motion\n5. Contrast ratio — difference between brightest white and darkest black; higher = better image depth\n6. Aspect ratio — ratio of width to height (e.g. 16:9 widescreen, 4:3 standard)",
  },

  },
  {
    id: 38,
    unit: "hw",
    q: "Compare laser, inkjet, and dot matrix printers.",
    a: "Laser: uses toner and heat, fast, high quality, expensive to buy but cheap per page, best for high-volume text printing.\nInkjet: uses liquid ink cartridges, good colour/photo printing, cheaper to buy but expensive per page, slower than laser, ink can smudge.\nDot matrix (impact): uses pins striking an ink ribbon, noisy, low quality, slow, but can print carbon copies (multi-part forms) — unique advantage.",
  },
  {
    id: 39,
    unit: "hw",
    q: "What is the unique advantage of a dot matrix printer over laser and inkjet printers?",
    a: "A dot matrix printer can print carbon copies (multi-part forms/duplicate copies) because it is an impact printer — the pins physically strike through multiple layers of paper. Laser and inkjet printers cannot do this because they are non-impact printers.",
  },
  {
    id: 40,
    unit: "hw",
    q: "Define keylogger, spyware, Trojan, and malware.",
    a: "Keylogger: software or hardware that secretly records every keystroke a user types, often used to steal passwords and personal information.\nSpyware: software that secretly monitors and collects user activity and personal information without consent.\nTrojan: malicious software disguised as legitimate software; once installed, it allows unauthorised access to the computer.\nMalware: a general term for any malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or damage a computer system (includes viruses, worms, spyware, Trojans, ransomware).",

    q: "What does VLOOKUP do and what are its four arguments?",
    a: "VLOOKUP (Vertical Lookup) searches for a value in the leftmost column of a table and returns a value from the same row in a specified column.\nSyntax: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])\n1. lookup_value — the value to search for\n2. table_array — the range containing the data\n3. col_index_num — the column number to return the value from\n4. range_lookup — TRUE (approximate) or FALSE (exact match)",
  },
  {
    id: 42,
    unit: "solution-dev",
    q: "What is the difference between VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP?",
    a: "VLOOKUP (Vertical Lookup) searches down the FIRST COLUMN of a table and returns a value from the same ROW.\nHLOOKUP (Horizontal Lookup) searches across the FIRST ROW of a table and returns a value from the same COLUMN.\nUse VLOOKUP when data is arranged in columns; use HLOOKUP when data is arranged in rows.",
  },
  {
    id: 43,
    unit: "solution-dev",
    q: "How does the INDEX function work? How does it combine with MATCH?",
    a: "INDEX(array, row_num, [col_num]) returns the value at a given row and column position in a range.\nMATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type]) returns the position (row number) of a value in a range.\nTogether: =INDEX(return_range, MATCH(lookup_value, search_range, 0)) — MATCH finds the position, INDEX returns the value at that position. More flexible than VLOOKUP as it can look left.",
