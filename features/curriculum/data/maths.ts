        "content": "A function is a relation where each input (x-value) produces exactly one output (y-value). The vertical line test confirms whether a graph represents a function.\n\nThe inverse of a function f is found by swapping x and y in the equation and solving for y. The inverse function f⁻¹ undoes what f does. Graphically, f and f⁻¹ are reflections of each other in the line y = x. The domain of f becomes the range of f⁻¹ and vice versa.\n\nLinear functions f(x) = ax + q always have inverses that are functions. For the parabola f(x) = ax², swapping gives x = ay², so y = ±√(x/a). This relation is NOT a function (each x gives two y-values), so the domain of the original parabola must be restricted. Restricting to x ≥ 0 gives the inverse y = √(x/a); restricting to x ≤ 0 gives y = -√(x/a).\n\nThe exponential function f(x) = bˣ (b > 0, b ≠ 1) has the logarithmic function f⁻¹(x) = log_b(x) as its inverse. Key features of y = bˣ: domain all real numbers, range y > 0, passes through (0,1), horizontal asymptote y = 0. Key features of y = log_b(x): domain x > 0, range all real numbers, passes through (1,0), vertical asymptote x = 0.\n\nTo sketch an inverse: reflect the original graph in y = x, equivalently swap all x and y coordinates. The x-intercept of f becomes the y-intercept of f⁻¹. A horizontal asymptote becomes a vertical asymptote. The function and its inverse intersect on the line y = x."

If DE ∥ BC in △ABC, then AD/DB = AE/EC. The converse also holds: if a line divides two sides proportionally, it is parallel to the third side. Proof uses the area method — triangles sharing the same height have areas in proportion to their bases.\n\nThe Midpoint Theorem is a special case: the segment joining the midpoints of two sides is parallel to the third side and half its length.\n\nTwo triangles are similar (|||) if all corresponding angles are equal (AAA) or all corresponding sides are in proportion. In practice, showing two pairs of equal angles (AA) is sufficient. If △ABC ||| △DEF with scale factor k, then the ratio of their areas is k².\n\nThe Theorem of Pythagoras: in a right-angled triangle, c² = a² + b² (hypotenuse squared equals sum of squares of other two sides). The elegant proof uses similar triangles: in △ABC with C = 90°, dropping the altitude from C to hypotenuse AB creates triangles △ACD and △BCD, both similar to △ABC, giving AC² = AD·AB and BC² = BD·AB, which sum to AB²."

Angles in the same segment (same side of a chord) are equal. The angle in a semicircle is always 90°.\n\nA cyclic quadrilateral has all four vertices on the circle. Its opposite angles are supplementary (sum to 180°). An exterior angle of a cyclic quadrilateral equals the interior opposite angle. To prove a quadrilateral is cyclic: show opposite angles are supplementary, or that an exterior angle equals the interior opposite angle, or that two points subtend equal angles to a line segment from the same side.\n\nTangent properties: A tangent is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Two tangents from the same external point are equal in length, and the line from the external point to the centre bisects the angle between the tangents.\n\nThe Tangent-Chord (Tan-Chord) theorem: the angle between a tangent and a chord at the point of tangency equals the inscribed angle in the alternate segment. This is extremely useful for finding unknown angles in problems involving tangents.\n\nChord theorems: The perpendicular from the centre to a chord bisects the chord. Equal chords subtend equal angles at the centre and are equidistant from the centre."

Decay (depreciation): simple (straight-line) A = P(1-in); compound (reducing balance) A = P(1-i)ⁿ.\n\nNominal vs effective rates: When compounding more than once per year, the nominal rate (stated rate) differs from the effective annual rate (EAR). EAR = (1 + iₙₒₘ/m)ᵐ - 1 where m is the number of compounding periods per year. Always convert nominal rates to effective rates when comparing investments.\n\nAnnuities are regular equal payments.
