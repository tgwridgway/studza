  },
  {
    id: 32,
    unit: "rna",
    q: "What is an anticodon?",
    a: "An anticodon is a set of three exposed nitrogenous bases on a tRNA molecule. It is complementary to a specific codon on the mRNA strand and ensures the correct amino acid is delivered during protein synthesis.",

    id: 35,
    unit: "rna",
    q: "What is transcription?",
    a: "Transcription is the process by which mRNA is formed in the nucleoplasm using one strand of DNA as a template. The genetic code is copied from DNA to mRNA.",
  },
  {
    id: 36,
    unit: "dna",
    q: "Why does a large base always pair with a small base in DNA?",
    a: "A large base (purine — Adenine or Guanine) always pairs with a small base (pyrimidine — Thymine or Cytosine) to maintain the uniform width of the DNA double helix. Two large bases would be too wide and two small bases would be too narrow.",
  },
  {
    id: 37,
    unit: "rna",
    q: "Explain why identical twins have identical DNA profiles but non-identical twins do not.",
    a: "Identical twins develop from the same fertilised egg (zygote) that splits, so they share exactly the same DNA. Non-identical twins develop from two different fertilised eggs, each with a unique combination of DNA from the parents.",

    unit: "dna",
    q: "What contribution did Rosalind Franklin make to the discovery of DNA structure?",

  },
  {
    id: 42,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "What are homologous chromosomes?",
    a: "Homologous chromosomes are a pair of chromosomes (one from each parent) that have the same length, same centromere position, and carry genes for the same characteristics at the same loci (positions). They are NOT identical — they may carry different alleles.",
  },
  {
    id: 43,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "What is a bivalent (tetrad)?",
    a: "A bivalent is a pair of homologous chromosomes that lie closely together during prophase I of meiosis. Since each chromosome consists of 2 sister chromatids, a bivalent consists of 4 chromatids (hence also called a tetrad).",
  },
  {
    id: 44,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "What is crossing over and when does it occur?",
    a: "Crossing over occurs during prophase I when homologous chromosomes are paired as bivalents. Non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes exchange segments of DNA at points called chiasmata. This results in new combinations of alleles, increasing genetic variation.",
  },
  {
    id: 45,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "Describe what happens during Prophase I of meiosis.",
    a: "1. Chromosomes shorten and thicken (condense).\n2. Homologous chromosomes pair up to form bivalents (synapsis).\n3. Crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids at chiasmata.\n4. Nuclear membrane and nucleolus disappear.\n5. Centrioles move to opposite poles and spindle fibres form.",
  },
  {
    id: 46,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "Describe what happens during Metaphase I.",
    a: "Bivalents (homologous pairs) line up at the cell equator/metaphase plate. The orientation of each pair is random (random arrangement/independent assortment). Spindle fibres attach to the centromeres.",
  },
  {
    id: 47,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "Describe what happens during Anaphase I.",
    a: "Homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. The centromeres do NOT split — each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere. This is the reduction division — chromosome number is halved.",
  },
  {
    id: 48,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "Describe what happens during Telophase I and cytokinesis.",
    a: "Chromosomes reach the poles. Nuclear membranes may reform. The cell divides by cytokinesis to form two haploid daughter cells. Each cell has half the chromosome number of the original cell. A short interkinesis (rest period) may follow — NO DNA replication occurs.",
  },
  {
    id: 49,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "Describe Meiosis II briefly (Prophase II → Telophase II).",
    a: "Prophase II: Chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane disappears, spindle forms.\nMetaphase II: Chromosomes line up individually at the equator.\nAnaphase II: Centromeres split — sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.\nTelophase II: Nuclear membranes reform, cytokinesis occurs.\nResult: 4 haploid daughter cells.",
  },
  {
    id: 50,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "Why is meiosis important? List 4 reasons.",
    a: "1. Produces haploid gametes — ensures chromosome number is maintained after fertilisation.\n2. Crossing over creates new allele combinations (genetic variation).\n3. Random/independent assortment of homologous chromosomes creates unique gametes.\n4. Genetic variation is essential for natural selection and evolution.",
  },
  {
    id: 51,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "How does meiosis contribute to genetic variation? Name 3 mechanisms.",
    a: "1. Crossing over (prophase I): exchange of DNA between non-sister chromatids creates new allele combinations.\n2. Independent/random assortment (metaphase I): random orientation of bivalents means each gamete gets a unique combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes.\n3. Random fertilisation: any sperm can fertilise any egg, further increasing variation.",
  },
  {
    id: 52,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "Compare meiosis I and meiosis II.",
    a: "Meiosis I (reduction division): homologous chromosomes separate; crossing over occurs; bivalents line up at equator; centromeres do NOT split; results in 2 haploid cells.\nMeiosis II (similar to mitosis): sister chromatids separate; chromosomes line up individually; centromeres DO split; results in 4 haploid cells.",
  },
  {
    id: 53,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "What is non-disjunction?",
    a: "Non-disjunction is the failure of homologous chromosomes (in meiosis I) or sister chromatids (in meiosis II) to separate properly during cell division. This results in gametes with abnormal chromosome numbers — either one extra (n+1) or one missing (n-1).",
  },
  {
    id: 54,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "What is Down syndrome and how does it occur?",
    a: "Down syndrome (trisomy 21) occurs when there are three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two. It is caused by non-disjunction during meiosis, producing a gamete with an extra chromosome 21. After fertilisation, the zygote has 47 chromosomes instead of 46.",
  },
  {
    id: 55,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "What is a karyotype?",
    a: "A karyotype is a photograph or diagram of all the chromosomes in a cell, arranged in homologous pairs from largest to smallest. It is used to identify chromosome abnormalities such as Down syndrome (extra chromosome 21) or Turner syndrome (missing X).",
  },
  {
    id: 56,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "Compare mitosis and meiosis (at least 5 differences).",
    a: "1. Mitosis: 1 division; Meiosis: 2 divisions.\n2. Mitosis: 2 identical diploid cells; Meiosis: 4 genetically different haploid cells.\n3. Mitosis: no crossing over; Meiosis: crossing over in prophase I.\n4. Mitosis: individual chromosomes at equator; Meiosis I: bivalents at equator.\n5. Mitosis: occurs in body cells for growth/repair; Meiosis: occurs in gonads for gamete production.\n6. Mitosis: daughter cells are genetically identical; Meiosis: daughter cells are genetically unique.",
  },
  {
    id: 57,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "What is synapsis?",
    a: "Synapsis is the pairing of homologous chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis to form bivalents. The chromosomes align closely together along their entire length.",
  },
  {
    id: 58,
    unit: "meiosis",
    q: "What are chiasmata (singular: chiasma)?",
    a: "Chiasmata are the points where non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes cross over and exchange genetic material during prophase I. They are visible evidence that crossing over has occurred.",

  {
    id: 62,
    unit: "hormones",
    q: "Where are auxins produced and what is the main natural auxin?",

  },
  {
    id: 63,
    unit: "hormones",
    q: "Explain how auxin causes phototropism in a shoot.",
    a: "Auxin moves to the SHADED side of the shoot. Higher auxin concentration causes cells to elongate MORE on that side. The shoot bends TOWARDS the light (positive phototropism).",
  },
  {
    id: 64,
    unit: "hormones",
    q: "Why do roots and shoots respond differently to the same auxin concentration?",
    a: "Shoots are stimulated by high auxin (cells elongate more). Roots are INHIBITED by high auxin. In a horizontal plant, auxin on the lower side: shoot bends UP (stimulated), root bends DOWN (inhibited below, grows more above).",
  },
  {
    id: 65,
    unit: "hormones",
    q: "What is apical dominance?",

  },
  {
    id: 67,
    unit: "hormones",
    q: "Why is abscisic acid called the stress hormone?",
    a: "ABA helps plants cope with unfavourable conditions: stomatal closure during drought, seed dormancy in bad conditions, bud dormancy in winter. It generally SLOWS DOWN or STOPS growth.",

  {
    id: 74,
    unit: "protein-synthesis",
    q: "What is protein synthesis?",

    id: 77,
    unit: "protein-synthesis",
    q: "What is the genetic code?",
    a: "The genetic code is the sequence of bases on mRNA (codons) that codes for the sequence of amino acids in a protein. It is a triplet code — every three consecutive bases (codon) code for one amino acid.",

    unit: "protein-synthesis",
    q: "List four properties of the genetic code.",
    a: "1. Triplet: three bases code for one amino acid.\n2. Degenerate (redundant): more than one codon can code for the same amino acid (e.g., there are 64 codons but only 20 amino acids).\n3. Universal: the same codons code for the same amino acids in almost all organisms.\n4. Non-overlapping: codons are read sequentially without sharing bases.",
